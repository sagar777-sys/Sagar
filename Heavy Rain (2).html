            <h3 align="center"><strong> SOME IMPORTANT POINT TO STAY SAFE</strong></h3>
           <p> 
   <strong> 1.Avoid Travel:</strong> If possible, stay indoors and avoid traveling in heavy   rain, as roads could become flooded and dangerous.<br>

<strong>2.Secure Outdoor Items:</strong> Make sure outdoor furniture, motorcycles, or any other items are secured to prevent them from being damaged or blown away by strong winds that may accompany the rain.<br>

<strong>3.Prepare for Power Outages:</strong> Heavy rain can cause power outages, so it’s a good idea to have flashlights, batteries, and emergency supplies on hand.<br>

<strong>4.Stay Updated:</strong> Keep an eye on local weather forecasts and alerts from reliable sources.
